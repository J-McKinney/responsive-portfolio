           Well, what's to say? I'm 33 years old, I just 
        got married last September, life is good. Just 
        repetitive... My life outside of work is great, 
        spontaneous, and exciting. That's why I decided 
        to go for a career change. I've seen it all and 
        done it all, as a bartender. I started in the food
        and beverage industry when I was 16 years old. I 
        started as a dishwasher, busboy, server, etc... 
        And, so on. And, so forth. After 17 years of doing 
        this and the wide experience of fine dining and 
        "THE RUSH" of casual dining. Nothing is unexpected 
        anymore. So, I got bored and picked up hobbies, to 
        unleash a more creative side of myself. While still 
        working full-time, I decided to do a little wood 
        working. It started off small, then it got bigger.
        Along with building my own workbench to the patio 
        furniture on my deck. What can I say? The feeling 
        you get when a plan goes into action and the end 
        result is even better than you thought it would 
        be. Unbelievable!!! You don't want to stop. You 
        want to go out and build a house, from the ground 
        up. The only, tiniest, minute, pocket-sized 
        problem with that is....   After, I got done with 
        those projects, I had nothing in my pockets to 
        afford new material, for the new projects. So, 
        looking for an alternative. I had a friend suggest 
        the tech frontier. So, I looked into it. We live in 
        the digital age, the age of computers and technology. 
        You want to know what I saw? I saw a "free, limitless, 
        canvas of creativivty". HTML is my hammer and saw, CSS 
        is my endless lumber yard. Now, that I have started 
        this. I don't want it to end...
